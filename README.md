This is my personal portfolio and showcase of projects I have done.

The portfolio shall consist of 4 pages: Home, Projects, Contact and Blog. And a header that will be shown in all pages. And there will also be a customised 404 page in case.   

The page's look shall fit into all devices, including typical desktop(1440px), tablet(768px) and mobile(320px) devices.

Dependencies I will use in this project:
    
    react-router-dom for routing though pages a
    react-bootstrap for styling
    date-fns for time formats 
    fontawesome for icons
